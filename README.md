"OVERVIEW OF PROJECT"

PROJECT : FINITE STATE MACHINE (FSM) DESIGN

OBJECTIVE
 Design FSMs using Verilog or VHDL in the VLSI software
 environment. Write testbenches to test different states and
 transitions of the FSM. Simulate the FSM behavior and verify its
 correctness.

 KEY ACTIVITIES
 1- 101 sequence detector desigh using ise xilinx
 2- wrote the test benches to verify the code

 TECHNOLOGY USED
 VERILOG : PROGRAMING LANGUAGE TO DESGIN THE CIRCUIT
 WAVEFORM : USE WAVEFORM VIWER TO ANALYS THE CORRECTNESS OF CODE
 application : ISE xilinx
